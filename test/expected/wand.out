-- BMW Multi-term Scoring Bug Test
--
-- This test exposes a critical bug in multi-term BMW scoring.
-- Documents appearing at different block positions across terms' posting
-- lists get partial scores instead of complete scores.
--
-- The bug: Block-index iteration processes blocks by index (0, 1, 2, ...)
-- assuming blocks are aligned by doc ID across terms. They're not.
-- A document in block 1 of "alpha" and block 3 of "beta" gets scored
-- twice with partial scores, neither of which is correct.

INFO:  This release contains breaking changes in the bm25 index structure and will require existing indexes to be rebuilt.
