-- BM25 Score Validation Functions
--
-- Formula: BM25(q,d) = Σ IDF(qi) * (tf(qi,d) * (k1 + 1)) / (tf(qi,d) + k1 * (1 - b + b * |d| / avgdl))
-- Where:
--   IDF(qi) = ln(1 + (N - df(qi) + 0.5) / (df(qi) + 0.5))
--   tf(qi,d) = term frequency of qi in document d
--   |d| = document length, avgdl = average document length
--   k1 = term frequency saturation, b = length normalization
--
-- Usage Example:
--   SELECT validate_bm25_scoring('mytable', 'content_column', 'my_bm25_idx', 'search query', 'english', 1.2, 0.75)
