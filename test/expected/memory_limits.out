-- Memory limits testing note
-- 
-- Memory budget enforcement testing requires server restart to change 
-- tapir.shared_memory_size, so comprehensive memory limits testing
-- is done in test/scripts/memory_limits.sh instead.
--
-- This test just verifies that the extension can be created
-- and basic memory budget constants are defined.
-- Extension should already be available since tests are run with shared_preload_libraries
SELECT 'Extension availability test' as test;
            test             
-----------------------------

-- Test that the extension constants are properly defined
-- (This doesn't require actual memory limit testing)

                   test
