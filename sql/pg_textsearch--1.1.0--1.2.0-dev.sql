-- Upgrade from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0-dev

-- Verify the library is loaded. The version-equality check lives in
-- the main install file (pg_textsearch--<default_version>.sql); upgrade
-- scripts must accept any loaded version because they may run as
-- intermediate steps in a chain that ends at default_version, not at
-- the version named in this filename.
